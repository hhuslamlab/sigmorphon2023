# Task 2 of the SIGMORPHON–UniMorph Shared Task on Typologically Diverse and Acquisition-Inspired Morphological Inflection Generation

_Description_: This is the code and data repository of Task 2 of the SIGMORPHON–UniMorph Shared Task on Typologically Diverse and Acquisition-Inspired Morphological Inflection Generation.
The repository contains the code and analysis scripts for both modelling approaches (Linear Discriminative Learning and Transformer).
Each modelling approach has two parts (Study 1 and Study 2). In addition, there is an analysis on the variability of the experimental data.
